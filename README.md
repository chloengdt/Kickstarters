### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
### I encountered difficulty when trying to insert the "Outcomes Based on Goal" line graph. The "Percentage failed" line didn't show on my graph and I looked up information online on how to Plot series on the Secondary Axis. 
## Results
- Outcomes based on Launch Date
#### This analysis examines the data of theater campaigns, which shows a higher success rate than a failed rate based on the launch date. May and Jun were the months that had the highest launching campaign and had the highest success full rate.
- Outcomes based on Goals
#### This analysis examines the data of the plays campaign, the analysis shows there was a higher percentage of successful plays campaigns than failed ones, there was no canceled play. Campaigns that had lower monetary goals yielded a higher success rate than those with high monetary goals.
#### The data set has outliers (extremely large monetary goals such as $10,000,000 up to $100,000,000.00) as they are unrealistic and will affect the result of the analysis. 
### Recommendation:
#### Eliminate outliers and analyze by create more tables and charts for different categories and subcategories and countries vs pledge data will represent more realistic outcomes analysis.
