##Overview of Project:
###This Analysis is an examination for the campaign of The Theater Performance Outcomes based on Goals that they need to be success 
##Analysis and Challenge:
###I encountered a difficulty when trying to insert the "Outcomes Based on Goal" line graph. The "Percentage fail" line didn't show on my graph and I looked up information online on how to Plot series on Secondary Axis. 
##Result:
###Theater Outcomes by Launch Date analysis
####This analysis examines the data of theater campaigns, which shows higher successful rate than failed rate based on launch date. May and Jun were the months had the highest launching campaign and had the highest success full rate. 
###See the Graph and table from file link below:

###Outcomes based on Goals analysis 
####This analysis examines the data of the plays campaign, the analysis shows there were higher percentage of successful plays campaigns than failed ones, there were no canceled play. Campaigns that had lower monetary goals yield higher successful rate than that with high monetary goals.

###Limitation of data sets
####The data set has outliers (extremely large monetary goals such as 10,000,000 up to $100,000,000.00) as they are unrealistic and will affect the result of the analysis. 
###Recommendation:
####More tables and charts for different categories and subcategories and countries vs pledge data will represent more realistic outcomes analysis.
