##Overview of Project:
###This Analysis is an examination for the campaign of The Theater Performance Outcomes based on Goals that they need to be successful
##Analysis and Challenge:
###I encountered difficulty when trying to insert the "Outcomes Based on Goal" line graph. The "Percentage fail" line didn't show on my graph and I looked up information online on how to Plot series on the Secondary Axis. 
##Result:
###Theater Outcomes by Launch Date analysis
####This analysis examines the data of theater campaigns, which shows a higher success rate than a failed rate based on the launch date. May and Jun were the months that had the highest launching campaign and had the highest success full rate. 
###See the Graph and table from the file link below:

###Outcomes based on Goals analysis 
####This analysis examines the data of the plays campaign, the analysis shows there was a higher percentage of successful plays campaigns than failed ones, there was no canceled play. Campaigns that had lower monetary goals yielded a higher success rate than those with high monetary goals.

###Limitation of data sets
####The data set has outliers (extremely large monetary goals such as 10,000,000 up to $100,000,000.00) as they are unrealistic and will affect the result of the analysis. 
###Recommendation:
####More tables and charts for different categories and subcategories and countries vs pledge data will represent more realistic outcomes analysis.
